<p> I look up to historical figures who led their lives with principles and idealism. <br>
Some of them are <ul type="square">
<li> Franklin D Roosevelt - He served as the 32nd President of the United States. He pulled the country out of the Great Depression and led the country to victory in WWII. </li>
<li> Shubhash Chandra Bose - He needs no introduction. He created Azad Hind Fauj and instilled fire of independence in millions of Indians.  </li>
<li> Nelson Mandela - Inspired by the ideas of Mahatama Gandhi, He was instrumental in ending apartheid in South Africa. He spent 27 years in jail and also served as President of the country. </li>
</ul>
